Azure Stack Post Install Scripts

You can execute the the files here in a post install of a Azure Stack ASDK to install PowerShell, Install Azure Stack Tools and Register the ASDK with your Azure Subscription so that you can access the marketplace. 

Add a copy of CONFIGASDK.ps1 created by Alain Vetier which is a great script for complete costomization of a ASDK post install. This will likley require updates in order to stay in sync with Microsoft updates.
